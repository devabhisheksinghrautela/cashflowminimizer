# cashflowminimizer
This is a cash flow minimizer app using C++ 

A cash flow minimizer in C++ is typically a program designed to handle financial operations, particularly the task of reducing or optimizing cash flow. Cash flow refers to the movement of money into and out of a business or individual's account. Optimizing cash flow typically involves reducing expenses, increasing income, or strategically managing the timing of payments and receipts.

Key Concepts for Cash Flow Minimization: <br>

Receipts: Money received, such as income, investments, etc.<br>
Payments: Money paid out, including expenses, bills, loans, etc.<br>
Surplus/Deficit: The difference between total receipts and total payments.<br>
Optimization: Finding the least cost or most efficient strategy for cash inflow and outflow.<br>
Cash Flow Planning: Predicting future cash flows to identify times of surplus or shortfall.<br>

Approach to Implementing Cash Flow Minimization <br>
Step 1: Define Structures for Cash Flows
We can create classes or structures in C++ to represent various financial components like payments, receipts, and transactions.

Step 2: Explanation of the Code
Transaction Structure:

amount: The financial value of the transaction.
type: Whether it's a "receipt" (income) or "payment" (expense).
description: A string that can hold a brief description of the transaction.
CashFlow Class:

addTransaction(): Adds a transaction (either a receipt or payment) to the list.
calculateNetFlow(): Calculates the total receipts and total payments, then returns the net flow (positive if receipts exceed payments, negative if the reverse).
minimizeFlow(): This is where the actual minimization logic takes place. If thereâ€™s a deficit (negative net flow), the program attempts to reduce the largest payment. If there's a surplus, it tries to increase receipts.
reducePayments(): Sorts transactions by the largest payments and attempts to reduce one of the largest payments by 25%.
increaseReceipts(): Increases one of the receipts by 10% to simulate increasing cash flow.
